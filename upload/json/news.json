The Altcoin Roundup newsletter is now authored by Cointelegraph\u2019s resident newsletter writer <a href=\"https:\/\/cointelegraph.com\/authors\/big-smokey\" data-amp=\"https:\/\/cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org\/c\/s\/cointelegraph.com\/authors\/big-smokey\/amp\">Big Smokey<\/a>. In the next few weeks, this newsletter will be renamed Crypto Market Musings, a weekly newsletter that provides ahead-of-the-curve analysis and tracks emerging trends in the crypto market.\u00a0<\/p><p>The publication date of the newsletter will remain the same, and the content will still place a heavy emphasis on the technical and fundamental analysis of cryptocurrencies from a more macro perspective in order to identify key shifts in investor sentiment and market structure. We hope you enjoy it! <\/p><h2>DeFi has a problem, pump and dumps<\/h2><p>When the bull market was in full swing, investing in decentralized finance (DeFi) tokens was like shooting fish in a barrel, but now that inflows to the sector pale in comparison to the market\u2019s heyday, it\u2019s much harder to identify good trades in the space. <\/p><p>During the DeFi summer, protocols were able to lure liquidity providers by offering three- to four-digit yields and mechanisms like liquid staking, lending via asset collateralization and token rewards for staking. The big issue was many of these reward offerings were unsustainable, and high emissions from some protocols led liquidity providers to auto-dump their rewards, creating constant sell pressure on a token\u2019s price. <\/p><p>Total value locked (TVL) wars were another challenge faced by DeFi protocols, which had to constantly vie for investor capital in order to maintain the number of \u201cusers\u201d willing to lock their funds within the protocol. This created a scenario where mercenary capital from whales and other cash-flush investors essentially <a href=\"https:\/\/cointelegraph.com\/news\/binance-delegates-13-2m-uni-tokens-becoming-uniswap-dao-s-second-largest-vote-holder\" data-amp=\"https:\/\/cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org\/c\/s\/cointelegraph.com\/news\/binance-delegates-13-2m-uni-tokens-becoming-uniswap-dao-s-second-largest-vote-holder\/amp\">airdropped funds to platforms offering the highest APY<\/a> rewards for a short period of time, before eventually dumping rewards in the open market and shifting the investment funds to the greener pastures. <\/p><p>For platforms that secured series funding from venture capitalists, the same sort of activity took place. VCs pledge funds in exchange for tokens, and these entities reside in the ranks of the largest tokenholders in the most lucrative liquidity pools. The looming threat of token unlocks from early investors, high reward emissions and the steady auto-dumping of said rewards led to constant sell pressure and obviously stood in the way of any investor deciding to make a long investment based on fundamental analysis. <\/p><p>Combined, each of these scenarios created a vicious cycle where protocol TVL and the platform\u2019s native token would basically launch, pump, dump and then slip into obscurity. <\/p><p>Rinse, wash, repeat. <\/p><p>So, how does one actually look beyond the candlestick chart to see if a DeFi platform is worth \u201cinvesting\u201d in? <\/p><p>Let\u2019s take a look. <\/p><h2>Is there revenue? <\/h2><p>Here are two charts. <\/p><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/s3.cointelegraph.com\/uploads\/2022-10\/41f01de5-537f-470c-a74f-198b44e0b95a.png\"><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Algorand market capitalization vs. revenue (180 days).

In the first chart, one will notice that Algorand (<a href=\"https:\/\/cointelegraph.com\/algorand-algo-price-index\">ALGO<\/a>) has a $2.15-billion circulating market cap and a fully diluted market cap of $3.06 billion. Yet its 30-day revenue and annualized revenue are $7,690 and $93,600, respectively. Eye-raising, isn\u2019t it? <\/p><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/s3.cointelegraph.com\/uploads\/2022-10\/2380fb0a-9884-451b-9904-726bec0a9a52.png\"><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Algorand protocol data.

Looking at the chart legend, one will also note that there are no token incentives or supply-side fees distributed to liquidity providers and token stakers.<\/p><p><strong><em>Related: <a href=\"https:\/\/cointelegraph.com\/news\/3-emerging-crypto-trends-to-keep-an-eye-on-while-bitcoin-price-consolidates\" data-amp=\"https:\/\/cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org\/c\/s\/cointelegraph.com\/news\/3-emerging-crypto-trends-to-keep-an-eye-on-while-bitcoin-price-consolidates\/amp\">3 emerging crypto trends to keep an eye on while Bitcoin price consolidates<\/a><\/em><\/strong><\/p><p>GMX, on the other hand, tells a different story. While maintaining a circulating market cap of $272 million and an annualized revenue of $28.92 million, GMX\u2019s cumulative supply-side fees have steadily increased to the tune of $33.9 million since April 24, 2022. Supply-side fees represent the percentage of fees that go to service providers, including liquidity providers. <\/p><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/s3.cointelegraph.com\/uploads\/2022-10\/f66bf7eb-2bcb-400e-bb8a-af1780334034.png\"><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>GMX cumulative supply side fees vs. revenue. Source: Token Terminal<\/em><\/figcaption><\/figure><h2>Issuance and inflation <\/h2><p>Before investing in a DeFi project, it\u2019s wise to take a look at the token\u2019s total supply, circulating supply, inflation rate and issuance rate. These metrics measure how many tokens are currently circulating in the market and the projected increase (issuance) of tokens in circulation. When it comes to DeFi tokens and altcoins, dilution is something that investors should be worried about, hence the allure of Bitcoin\u2019s (<a href=\"https:\/\/cointelegraph.com\/bitcoin-price\">BTC<\/a>) supply cap and low inflation. <\/p><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/s3.cointelegraph.com\/uploads\/2022-10\/aa05b760-f98d-413c-b8be-51a0d1c68a55.png\"><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Bitcoin issuance and inflation data. Source: Messari<\/em><\/figcaption><\/figure><p>As shown below, compared to BTC, ALGO\u2019s inflation rate and projected total supply are high. ALGO\u2019s total supply is capped at 10 billion, with data showing 7 billion tokens in circulation today, but given the current revenue generated from fees and the amount shared with tokenholders, the supply cap and inflation rate don\u2019t inspire much confidence. <\/p><p>Before taking up a position in ALGO, investors should look for more growth and daily active users of Algorand\u2019s DApp ecosystem, and there obviously needs to be an uptick in fees and revenue. <\/p><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/s3.cointelegraph.com\/uploads\/2022-10\/25411142-49e0-4981-a022-66afbca7aba6.png\"><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>ALGO issuance and inflation data.

Algorand has a multi-billion-dollar market cap and a 10-billion ALGO max supply, but low annual revenue and few token incentives present the question of whether the ecosystem\u2019s growth is anemic. <\/p><p>Viewing the chart below, we can see that ALGO active addresses are rising, but generally, the growth is flat, and active address spikes appear to follow price surges and sell-offs. As of Oct. 14, there were 72,624 active addresses on Algorand.<\/p><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/s3.cointelegraph.com\/uploads\/2022-10\/71b0fa6e-4d51-4bef-a1e8-f7670ff7411e.png\"><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>ALGO active address count.

The system, developed in conjunction with the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) Innovation Hub, has a unique structure that reflects the intricacies of the existing system for issuing money in Hong Kong.<\/p><p>Aurum consists of a wholesale interbank system and retail e-wallet. The e-wallet is created at a local bank and has a smartphone interface. A validator system prevents bank over-issuance and user double redemption. <\/p><p>The intermediated retail CBDC is used in the e-wallets, and CBDC-backed stablecoins are used in the interbank system. The unusual CBDC-backed stablecoins digitally mirror Hong Kong\u2019s existing currency system, in which bank notes are issued by three financial institutions and backed by the central bank. The CBDC is a direct liability of the central bank, while the stablecoins are liabilities of the issuing bank, with backing assets held by the central bank. The authors <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bis.org\/publ\/othp57.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">stated<\/a>:<\/p><blockquote>\u201cBringing CBDC-backed stablecoins to life has never been done before and we therefore felt that doing so may supplement the growing body of research on private sector stablecoins. Indeed, what distinguishes Aurum from private sector stablecoins is that Aurum\u2019s stablecoin balances are reconciled, versus real time gross settlement (RTGS) balances of the issuing bank with the central bank.\u201d <\/blockquote><p>The high level of decoupling between the wholesale and retail ledgers gives the system a high level of cyber-resilience, the designer said. <\/p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Join us at <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/HongKongFinTech?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@HongKongFinTech<\/a> 2022  on 31 Oct at 15:05 HK time when the <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/hashtag\/BISInnovationHub?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#BISInnovationHub<\/a> team in Hong Kong present Project Aurum, a prototype technology stack for retail <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/hashtag\/CBDC?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#CBDC<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/hkmagovhk?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@hkmagovhk<\/a> <br>Read more: <a href=\"https:\/\/t.co\/e3wJMWngv8\">https:\/\/t.co\/e3wJMWngv8<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/t.co\/fnxbxAN576\">pic.twitter.com\/fnxbxAN576<\/a><\/p>\u2014 Bank for International Settlements (@BIS_org) <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/BIS_org\/status\/1583434680028008449?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 21, 2022<\/a><\/blockquote>\n<script async src=\"https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script>\n<p>Retail transactions are performed with aliases.

A recent <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mckinsey.com\/industries\/financial-services\/our-insights\/web3-beyond-the-hype\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">article<\/a> from McKinsey noted that venture capital investments in Web3 exceeded $18 billion during the first half of 2022. Findings from Cointelegraph Research also show that Web3 <a href=\"https:\/\/cointelegraph.com\/news\/web3-dominates-venture-capital-interest-in-blockchain-industry-in-q2-2022\">attracted the most interest from venture capitalists<\/a> in comparison to other blockchain sectors during Q2 of this year.\u00a0<\/p><p>While notable, a lack of diversity has become apparent within the Web3 sector. For instance, it was found that <a href=\"https:\/\/cointelegraph.com\/news\/nfts-liberate-imagination-the-gender-gap-that-needs-to-be-addressed\">only 16% of nonfungible token (NFT) creators are women<\/a>. Although this number is low, women are <a href=\"https:\/\/cointelegraph.com\/news\/an-open-invitation-for-women-to-join-the-web3-movement\">taking an interest in owning digital assets<\/a>. Given this, industry experts believe that a lack of education around Web3 is creating a barrier to entry for women, especially for those who are from underrepresented regions, such as those from Latin America.<\/p><h2>Initiatives to bring Latin American women to Web3<\/h2><p>Sandy Carter, senior vice president and channel chief of Unstoppable Domains \u2014 an NFT domain name provider and digital identity platform \u2014 told Cointelegraph that she has seen increased demand for Web3 content from women living in Brazil, Columbia and several additional Spanish-speaking countries, including Spain.\u00a0<\/p><p>\u201cOn March 8, 2022, Unstoppable Domains launched \u2018Unstoppable Women of Web3,\u2019 which is a diversity and education group focusing on training talent to equalize the playing field in Web3. Following this, a number of Latinas reached out requesting Web3 content in various languages,\u201d she said. <\/p><p><strong><em>Recent: <a href=\"https:\/\/cointelegraph.com\/news\/crypto-adoption-how-fdic-insurance-could-bring-bitcoin-to-the-masses\">Crypto adoption: How FDIC insurance could bring Bitcoin to the masses<\/a><\/em><\/strong><\/p><p>In order to cater to these requests, Carter explained that Unstoppable Domains recently initiated a goal to <a href=\"https:\/\/es.cointelegraph.com\/news\/web3-educational-project-launched-focused-on-women-in-latam\">onboard 5 million Latin American women<\/a> into Web3 by 2030. Carter added that this initiative is being launched in partnership with H.E.R. DAO LATAM \u2014 a women-led developer decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) championing diversity \u2014 along with the Spanish-language crypto education platform CryptoConexi\u00f3n. She said: <\/p><blockquote>\u201cEducation is the first step to building a more inclusive Web3. We have partnered with women from 25 different groups to help create educational materials around Web3 in Spanish. We are also distributing over $25 million worth of free NFT domains to five million Latinas to help them build and control their digital identity as a gateway into the sector.\u201d\u00a0<\/blockquote><p>According to Carter, initiatives like these are becoming more important, as she pointed out that women who live in or trace their ancestry to Latin America continue to be underrepresented in the tech industry. To put this in perspective, <a href=\"https:\/\/builtin.com\/women-tech\/women-in-tech-workplace-statistics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">data<\/a> from the online tech community Built In found that only 2% of computing-related jobs in the United States are held by women of Latin American descent. The same applies in Latin America itself, where women are significantly underrepresented in science, technology, engineering and math fields, according to research from<a href=\"https:\/\/blogs.iadb.org\/igualdad\/en\/perceptions-women-and-girls-in-stem\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"> IDB<\/a>.\u00a0<\/p><p>Monica Talan, founder of CryptoConexi\u00f3n, told Cointelegraph that organizations must take an education-first approach that incorporates different languages to bridge the Web3 diversity gap, stating, \u201cCryptoConexi\u00f3n has an initiative called \u2018WAGMI LatAm,\u2019 where our mission is to ensure access to Web3 content in English, Spanish and Portuguese.\u201d <\/p><p>Additionally, Laura Navarro Mu\u00f1oz, governor of H.E.R.

Bricia Gabriela Guzm\u00e1n Ch\u00e1vez, community manager at Web3Equity \u2014 a Web3 platform promoting gender equality \u2014 told Cointelegraph that she got her first job in the sector after obtaining a scholarship from H.E.R.

According to World Bank <a href=\"https:\/\/www.worldbank.org\/en\/news\/press-release\/2022\/05\/11\/remittances-to-reach-630-billion-in-2022-with-record-flows-into-ukraine\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">statistics<\/a>, Mexico was the second-largest recipient of remittances in the world last year. Given this, a number of Web3 companies are <a href=\"https:\/\/cointelegraph.com\/news\/why-crypto-remittance-companies-are-flocking-to-mexico\">setting up shop in Mexico to enable crypto remittances<\/a>. \u201cWe need information available about how crypto remittances can be used. I believe this can be better achieved if we have more women building these products,\u201d Talan said. <\/p><h2>Challenges for Latin American women seeking jobs in Web3<\/h2><p>While it\u2019s notable that organizations are focused on bringing women from Latin America to the Web3 sector, challenges such as hiring freezes and access to technology <a href=\"https:\/\/cointelegraph.com\/news\/demand-for-talent-in-crypto-less-dependent-on-market-as-industry-matures\">may hamper adoption<\/a>. For instance, <a href=\"https:\/\/cryptojobslist.com\/trends\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">data<\/a> from Crypto Jobs List noted that the number of job listings and talent interested in the space has declined about 30%\u201340% in comparison to the last bull market in February 2022.<\/p><p>On the flip side, Web3 is <a href=\"https:\/\/cointelegraph.com\/news\/how-to-get-a-job-in-the-metaverse-and-web3\">enabling more remote job opportunities<\/a>, which may help drive a diverse workforce. \u201cWeb3 is helping people get high-paying jobs regardless of their location. All they need are the skills, which is why we are focused on education first,\u201d Navarro Mu\u00f1oz pointed out. <\/p><p><strong><em>Recent:\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/cointelegraph.com\/news\/institutional-crypto-adoption-requires-robust-analytics-for-money-laundering\">Institutional crypto adoption requires robust analytics for money laundering<\/a><\/em><\/strong><\/p><p>Diana Carolyn Olvera G\u00f3mez, a Web3 researcher, told Cointelegraph that H.E.R.

In turn, Olvera G\u00f3mez shared that she remotely serves as a contributor to Web3Montr\u00e9al, a Canadian nonprofit focused on Web3, and to Coinmiles, a Bitcoin (<a href=\"https:\/\/cointelegraph.com\/bitcoin-price\">BTC<\/a>) rewards platform.\u00a0<\/p><p>However, Olvera G\u00f3mez mentioned that access to technology, such as Web3 initiatives, can be complicated for many women living in regions like Latin America.

According to the community member, putting \u201crank\u201d in the NFT listing with no mention of \u201crarity\u201d anywhere could be misleading. <\/p><p>Taking the Moonbirds NFT collection as an example, the community member argued that since the collection enabled the OpenRarity ranking protocol, it destroyed its own market-driven rarity structure, making every single NFT a \u201cfloor Moonbird.\u201d The NFT collector also <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/sgsand1\/status\/1582036377155555333\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">called<\/a> out Kevin Rose, the CEO of Proof, the creators of Moonbird, to turn off the OpenRarity ranking function for the collection. <\/p><p>Days after the feedback, the NFT marketplace made some revisions to the ranking system. At the moment, NFT listings now show \u201crarity rank\u201d instead of just the rank. In addition to this, the NFT marketplace has also <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/opensea\/status\/1582471566335479808\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">added<\/a>\u00a0a trait count within the ranking methodology and a way to sort items with unique attributes before applying any additional information that elevates its rank. <\/p><p>After making the changes, OpenSea <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/opensea\/status\/1583125930004082689\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">announced<\/a> that it will enable the rarity ranking feature to eligible collections across all chains. The change will be implemented starting Oct. 25. According to the NFT marketplace, the most consistent feedback that they have received is from people asking how they could get access. To make this access possible for more collections, the marketplace will be implementing the feature to all their supported blockchains. <\/p><p><strong><em>Related: <\/em><\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/cointelegraph.com\/news\/prosecutors-argue-insider-trading-claim-in-the-opensea-case-is-accurate\" data-amp=\"https:\/\/cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org\/c\/s\/cointelegraph.com\/news\/prosecutors-argue-insider-trading-claim-in-the-opensea-case-is-accurate\/amp\"><strong><em>Prosecutors argue \u2018insider trading\u2019 claim in the OpenSea case is accurate<\/em><\/strong><\/a><\/p><p>The NFT marketplace first <a href=\"https:\/\/cointelegraph.com\/news\/opensea-implements-a-new-protocol-that-ranks-nft-rarity\" data-amp=\"https:\/\/cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org\/c\/s\/cointelegraph.com\/news\/opensea-implements-a-new-protocol-that-ranks-nft-rarity\/amp\">launched the NFT ranking protocol<\/a> on Sept. 21 in an attempt to provide a reliable rarity ranking for collectors.

The latter has been particularly hard hit by a \u201ccombination of mis-managed renewable energy policies, under investment in oil and gas, nuclear plant decomissionings, and Russia\u2019s war with Ukraine,\u201d which have sent energy prices sky-high.<\/p><p><a href=\"https:\/\/cointelegraph.com\/news\/top-3-reasons-why-bitcoin-hash-rate-continues-to-attain-new-all-time-highs\" data-amp=\"https:\/\/cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org\/c\/s\/cointelegraph.com\/news\/top-3-reasons-why-bitcoin-hash-rate-continues-to-attain-new-all-time-highs\/amp\"><strong><em>Related:\u00a0Top 3 reasons why Bitcoin hash rate continues to attain new all-time highs<\/em><\/strong><\/a><\/p><p>American miners have had to contend with the average cost of industrial electricity increasing 25% from $75.20 a megawatt hour to $94.30 per megawatt hour from July 2021 to July 2022. This has also had an effect on hosting service providers that are increasing their power prices in hosting contracts.<\/p><p>As hash price has dropped, some mining operators with mid-range equipment are facing down reaching breakeven costs margins. In the past, retail miners have either abandoned or sold rigs that are no longer profitable to mine. <\/p><p>Liquidating these assets is also becoming more difficult as Bitcoin mining values have been in decline throughout 2022. Rig prices dropped significantly in May and June but \u201cflattened\u201d in August and September according to the report, while the picture is still bleak:<\/p><blockquote>\u201cOld-gen machines like the S9 experienced a precipitous drawdown at the end of June amid Bitcoin\u2019s freefall to $17.5k. With mining economics in the dumpster, the S9 and\u00a0similar rigs have become unviable except in the cheapest energy markets.\u201d<\/blockquote><p>Publicly-traded mining firms have also faced increasing pressure with increasing interest rates and greater difficulty acquiring lines of credit. This has led to some firms turning to equity fundraising, which has the downside of diluting shareholders at lower stock prices. <\/p><p>However, these at-the-market offerings allow for quick capital raises, which can help fund continued expansion and operating costs through the ongoing bear market. <\/p><p>Miners have also had to sell BTC holdings in order to keep production going in 2022. However this rate has \u201cslowed progressively\u201d through the third quarter and public miners have sold fewer BTC than their monthly production in August and September for the first time since May.<\/p><p>Hashrate Index also cautioned that Q3 could be a precursor for more tough times for the mining industry with the potential for further distressed asset sales, bankruptcies and miner capitulation as the year comes to a close.<\/p><template data-name=\"subscription_form\" data-type=\"markets_outlook\"><\/template>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<\/p>\n                \n            "},{"title":"Global recession may last until near 2024 Bitcoin halving \u2014 Elon Musk","link":"https:\/\/cointelegraph.com\/news\/global-recession-may-last-until-near-2024-bitcoin-halving-elon-musk","enclosure":{"@attributes":{"url":"https:\/\/images.cointelegraph.com\/images\/840_aHR0cHM6Ly9zMy5jb2ludGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvbS91cGxvYWRzLzIwMjItMTAvMTY5NGIwMmItMjkzMC00MjMxLWI3M2UtZDBmMGUyOGJlNTQ5LmpwZw==.jpg","length":"840","type":"image\/jpg"}},"pubDate":"Fri, 21 Oct 2022 11:07:44 +0100","category":["Bitcoin"," BTC"," Elon Musk"," recession"," halving"],"guid":"https:\/\/cointelegraph.com\/news\/global-recession-may-last-until-near-2024-bitcoin-halving-elon-musk","description":"\n                \n                    <p style=\"float:right; margin:0 0 10px 15px; width:240px;\"><img src=\"https:\/\/images.cointelegraph.com\/images\/840_aHR0cHM6Ly9zMy5jb2ludGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvbS91cGxvYWRzLzIwMjItMTAvMTY5NGIwMmItMjkzMC00MjMxLWI3M2UtZDBmMGUyOGJlNTQ5LmpwZw==.jpg\" class=\"type:primaryImage\"><\/p>\n                    \n                    <p>The world could be stuck with recession until Spring 2024, Musk guesses in a fresh blow to the risk asset outlook.<\/p>\n                    <p><p>Bitcoin (<a href=\"https:\/\/cointelegraph.com\/bitcoin-price\">BTC<\/a>) may spend the time until its next block subsidy halving battling recession, Elon Musk suggested.<\/p><p>In a tweet on Oct. 21, the Tesla CEO <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/elonmusk\/status\/1583320632174837760\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">revealed<\/a> his belief that the world would only exit recession in Spring 2024.<\/p><h2>Musk: Recession will \u201cprobably\u201d stay until Q2, 2024<\/h2><p>After the United States entered a technical recession with its Q3 GDP data, debate continues over how much worse the scenario could get.<\/p><p>For Musk, while long predicting the United States economy <a href=\"https:\/\/cointelegraph.com\/news\/elon-musk-us-past-peak-inflation-after-tesla-sells-90-of-bitcoin\" data-amp=\"https:\/\/cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org\/c\/s\/cointelegraph.com\/news\/elon-musk-us-past-peak-inflation-after-tesla-sells-90-of-bitcoin\/amp\">would enter a recession<\/a>, the likelihood of a global downturn lingering is now real.<\/p><p>Asked on Twitter how long he considered a recession to last, the world\u2019s richest man was noncommittal, but erred on the side of years rather than months.<\/p><p>\u201cJust guessing, but probably until spring of \u201824,\u201d he wrote, having also said that \u201cit sure would be nice to have one year without a horrible global event.\u201d<\/p><p>Musk\u2019s latest prognosis appeared particularly painful for crypto commentators.<\/p><p>Still sensitive to macro market moves, BTC\/USD dipped below $19,000 on the day, data from <a href=\"https:\/\/pro.cointelegraph.com\/?via=markets&_ga=2.142027444.742658523.1640948929-762064149.1640948929\">Cointelegraph Markets Pro<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tradingview.com\/symbols\/BTCUSD\/?exchange=BINANCE\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">TradingView<\/a>\u00a0showed.\u00a0<\/p><p>Reactions to Musk digested the idea that it might take until Bitcoin\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/cointelegraph.com\/bitcoin-for-beginners\/bitcoin-halving-how-does-the-halving-cycle-work-and-why-does-it-matter\" data-amp=\"https:\/\/cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org\/c\/s\/cointelegraph.com\/bitcoin-for-beginners\/bitcoin-halving-how-does-the-halving-cycle-work-and-why-does-it-matter\/amp\">next halving<\/a> for price performance to see a significant trend change.
